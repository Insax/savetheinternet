    Upload filters on sites like Youtube, Facebook etc. have one thing in common: They will never work as accurate as a real human. As a consequence, copyrighted content that is used under fair use laws, gets deleted. This "tendancy" could be abused to filter content that's not in line with the companies values and interests.

    This censoring could flip the cultural norms of the internet, as we know them, upside-down.
    Upload-blocks in combination with error-prone algorithms potentially means that even something as simple as posting links, could soon become a problem.
    This will be patently obvious on sites like Twitter, Facebook, 9GAG etc.
    To be precise - all your favorite websites.
    Because Article 11 and 13 would mean that links or citations could be redacted, or stopped from being uploaded in the first place.

# Graphic box section
graphic_box_title1: 'Article 13 in detail'
graphic_box_content1: |
    Article 13 requires in practice that almost all internet platforms install a "filter robot" which automatically checks all uploaded content. This unduly restricts freedom of expression before it can be used. Content censorship decision is left to error-prone and oversensitive algorithms (programmed to "play it safe" and erase anything that creates a risk for the platform in case of doubt).
graphic_box_title2: 'Article 11 in detail'
graphic_box_content2: |
    In ancillary copyright law (Article 11), it is stipulated that the content of certain information providers will in future be subject to specific media law. This means that already quoted texts could be declared a copyright infringement.
    A large part of the providers of news on the net will be affected by this, since the use of external links will be restricted or paid.
    This also affects sites like Wikipedia, Stackoverflow and free bloggers.

# Image-split section
image_split_title: 'Article 11 not only affects the internet'

    Research and progress are also suffering from Article 11. In the future, users, such as independent researchers, journalists, individuals and various companies, will be denied text and data mining. This has a slowing effect on various discoveries of public interest.

about_title: 'About'
about_sub_title1: 'Stop the censorship machine - save the internet!'
about_sub_text1: 'The internet as you know it is in danger! The European Parliament is currently planning to tighten the copyright law, which would massively restrict your freedom on the internet.'

about_sub_title2: 'What you can expect'
about_sub_text2_1: 'On the 20th of June, the Legal Committee of the European Parliament will decide on a new copyright-reform. This could radically change copyright laws throughout the EU. Instead of supporting creators as originally intended, said reform could eventually backfire and impose a burden on them.'
about_sub_text2_2: 'Especially Article 11 and Article 13 of the reform would entail tremendous restrictions, not only for the consumers. Even big platforms such as Wikipedia and GitHub as well as the creators themselves would suffer under these new regulations:'

about_sub_title3: 'Ancillary Copyright'
about_sub_text3_1: 'Article 11 of the proposal of the European Commission is mainly focussing on the Ancillary Copyright of information providers. More specific press rights are going to protect the contents of these providers and will need a purchased license to be able to be used by others. Especially sites like Wikipedia are affected since cited texts could be seen as a copyright infringement under these new laws.'
about_sub_text3_2: 'The problem is simple: A big portion of news providers on the internet are financed by page impressions and the resulting ad income, which is generated by users visiting their site via external links.<br> If a platform is not willing or able to pay these licensing fees, they would lose those page views. The proposed law, originally supposed to support these providers, will now take away their means of existence.'

about_sub_title4: 'Upload-Filter'
about_sub_text4_1: 'Implementation of Article 13 results in a total real-time filtering of every piece of content that will be uploaded to the internet. What this means: Every data package will be automatically scanned by a potentially error-prone algorithm. This is comparable to the erroneous algorithm deployed by YouTube, which often mistakenly deletes content that is not protected by copyright law.'
about_sub_text4_2: 'If you think about the prospect of an algorithm that pre-analyses all the content that is uploaded to the internet, we take a further step towards the Orwellian dystopia of "1984". We are on the verge of a drastic reform that could change internet culture forever.'

about_sub_title5: 'Our demand to the EU'
about_sub_text5_1: 'We demand that the Committee on Legal Affairs should not make the same mistake as the European Parliament did two years ago. On 20th June 2018, vote against the reform of copyright law in the digital internal market, in particular Articles 11 and 13.'
about_sub_text5_2: >
    Through your position in Parliament, you have a duty to represent the opinions and values of your country's citizens and to uphold their freedom.
