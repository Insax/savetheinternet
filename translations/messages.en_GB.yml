    Upload filters on sites like YouTube, Facebook and the like all have one thing in common: They never act as precisely as a human could. As a result, content is often also removed that violates copyright but is protected by citation law. This "vulnerability" can be used as an excuse to remove content that does not correspond to one's own values and ideas.

Upload blocking in combination with error-prone algorithms ensure that even the posting of links will pose a massive problem in the future. This will be particularly evident on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, 9GAG and Co. In fact, most likely all of your favorite websites. Articles 11 and 13 would ensure that links and direct quotes are blacked out or even prevented entirely from uploading.'

# Graphic box section
graphic_box_title1: 'Article 13 in detail:'
graphic_box_content1: |
    In practice, Article 13 requires that almost all Internet platforms install a "filter robot" that automatically checks all uploaded content. This excessively restricts freedom of expression before it can even be exercised. Decisions on content censorship are left to error-prone and hypersensitive algorithms (programmed to "play it safe" and delete anything that could pose a risk to the platform).
graphic_box_title2: 'Article 11 in detail:'
graphic_box_content2: |
    The ancillary copyright law (Article 11) states that the future content of certain information providers will be subject to a more specific press law. This means that already quoted texts could be declared as copyright infringement. 
    A large part of the providers of news on the net will be affected, as the use of external links and references will be restricted or liable to costs.
    This also affects sites like Wikipedia, Stackoverflow and free bloggers.

# Image-split section
