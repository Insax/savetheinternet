    Upload filters on sites like Youtube, Facebook etc. have one thing in common: They will never work as accurate as a real human. As a consequence, copyrighted content that is used under fair use laws, gets deleted. This "tendancy" could be abused to filter content that's not in line with the companies values and interests.

    This censoring could flip the cultural norms of the internet, as we know them, upside-down.
    Upload-blocks in combination with error-prone algorithms potentially means that even something as simple as posting links, could soon become a problem.
    This will be patently obvious on sites like Twitter, Facebook, 9GAG etc.
    To be precise - all your favorite websites.
    Because Article 11 and 13 would mean that links or citations could be redacted, or stopped from being uploaded in the first place.

# Graphic box section
graphic_box_title1: 'Article 13 in detail'
graphic_box_content1: |
    Article 13 requires in practice that almost all internet platforms install a "filter robot" which automatically checks all uploaded content. This unduly restricts freedom of expression before it can be used. Content censorship decision is left to error-prone and oversensitive algorithms (programmed to "play it safe" and erase anything that creates a risk for the platform in case of doubt).
graphic_box_title2: 'Article 11 in detail'
graphic_box_content2: |
    In ancillary copyright law (Article 11), it is stipulated that the content of certain information providers will in future be subject to specific media law. This means that already quoted texts could be declared a copyright infringement.
    A large part of the providers of news on the net will be affected by this, since the use of external links will be restricted or paid.
    This also affects sites like Wikipedia, Stackoverflow and free bloggers.

# Image-split section

    Research and progress are also suffering from Article 11. In the future, users, such as independent researchers, journalists, individuals and various companies, will be denied text and data mining. This has a slowing effect on various discoveries of public interest.
